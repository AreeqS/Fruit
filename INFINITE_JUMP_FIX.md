# Infinite Jump Fix Guide

## üö® **Issue Fixed:**

‚úÖ **Infinite jumping**: Fixed jump count logic that was allowing unlimited jumps

## üîß **What Was Wrong:**

### **Before (Problematic):**
```csharp
// Ground jump was setting jumpsRemaining = maxJumps - 1
// This meant you always had 1 jump left, allowing infinite jumping
jumpsRemaining = maxJumps - 1; // ‚ùå WRONG - leaves 1 jump available
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```csharp
// Ground jump now sets jumpsRemaining = 0
// This means no more jumps until you land again
jumpsRemaining = 0; // ‚úÖ CORRECT - no jumps left until landing
```

## üéØ **How Jump System Now Works:**

### **Ground Jump:**
1. Player touches ground ‚Üí `jumpsRemaining = maxJumps` (2 jumps)
2. Player presses jump ‚Üí `jumpsRemaining = 0` (no more jumps)
3. Player must land again to get more jumps

### **Air Jump (Double Jump):**
1. Player is in air with `jumpsRemaining > 0`
2. Player presses jump ‚Üí `jumpsRemaining--` (uses 1 air jump)
3. No more jumps until landing

## üîç **Debug Tools Added:**

### **Console Logging:**
- Shows when jumps are reset
- Shows when jumps are executed
- Shows remaining jump count
- Shows when jump attempts fail

### **Manual Testing:**
- Right-click on PlayerControls script in Inspector
- Select **"Test Jump System"** to see current state
- Select **"Test Ground Detection"** to check ground status

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Jump Settings:**

### **Current Configuration:**
```
Max Jumps: 2 (double jump capability)
Jump Force: 6 (controlled jump height)
Coyote Time: 0.1 (forgiving jump timing)
```

### **To Change Jump Behavior:**

#### **Single Jump Only:**
```
Max Jumps: 1
```

#### **Triple Jump:**
```
Max Jumps: 3
```

#### **No Air Control:**
```
Max Jumps: 1
```

## üéÆ **Testing Your Fix:**

1. **Save the script** and return to Unity
2. **Play the game** and watch the Console
3. **Try jumping** - should only get 2 jumps total (1 ground + 1 air)
4. **Land on ground** - should reset jump count
5. **Check Console** for jump debug messages

## üîß **If Still Having Issues:**

### **Check Console Messages:**
- Look for "Grounded - Jumps reset to: X"
- Look for "Ground jump executed - Jumps remaining: X"
- Look for "Air jump executed - Jumps remaining: X"

### **Verify Ground Detection:**
- Use **"Test Ground Detection"** context menu
- Check if ground objects have colliders
- Verify ground layer is set correctly

### **Check Jump Count:**
- Use **"Test Jump System"** context menu
- Verify `jumpsRemaining` resets to `maxJumps` when grounded
- Verify `jumpsRemaining` goes to 0 after ground jump

## üì± **Expected Behavior:**

- **On ground**: Can jump once
- **In air**: Can jump once more (double jump)
- **After double jump**: No more jumps until landing
- **Landing**: Jump count resets to 2

The infinite jumping should now be completely fixed!
