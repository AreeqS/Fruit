# Movement & Jump Tuning Guide

## üéØ **Current Settings (Optimized for Smooth Movement):**

### **Movement Settings:**
```
Move Speed: 3 (was 5) - Smoother, more controlled movement
Jump Force: 6 (was 10) - Lower jump height, more manageable
Dash Force: 15 (was 20) - Less extreme dashing
Max Fall Speed: 12 (was 15) - Less extreme falling
```

### **Movement Feel:**
- **Smoother acceleration** when starting to move
- **Better deceleration** when stopping
- **Air control** while jumping (limited to prevent unrealistic movement)
- **Controlled jump height** that's not too extreme

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Fine-Tuning Values:**

### **If Jump is Still Too High:**
```
Jump Force: 5 (very low jump)
Jump Force: 4 (minimal jump)
```

### **If Movement is Too Slow:**
```
Move Speed: 4 (faster movement)
Move Speed: 5 (original speed)
```

### **If Movement is Too Fast:**
```
Move Speed: 2.5 (slower movement)
Move Speed: 2 (very slow movement)
```

### **For More Responsive Movement:**
```
Move Speed: 4
Acceleration: 0.3 (in HandleBetterJump method)
Deceleration: 0.2 (in FixedUpdate)
```

### **For More Floaty Movement:**
```
Jump Force: 7
Fall Multiplier: 2.0 (less aggressive falling)
Air Control: 0.7 (more air movement)
```

## üéÆ **Movement Features Added:**

### **Smooth Acceleration:**
- Player now accelerates smoothly when starting to move
- No more instant speed changes

### **Better Deceleration:**
- Player slows down more naturally when stopping
- Prevents sliding on ice feeling

### **Air Control:**
- Limited horizontal movement while jumping
- More realistic air movement
- Prevents unrealistic mid-air direction changes

### **Controlled Physics:**
- Jump height is now manageable
- Fall speed is limited for safety
- Movement feels more polished

## üîß **Advanced Tuning:**

### **For Platformer Feel:**
```
Move Speed: 3
Jump Force: 6
Fall Multiplier: 2.5
Air Control: 0.3
```

### **For Precise Platformer:**
```
Move Speed: 2.5
Jump Force: 5
Fall Multiplier: 3.0
Air Control: 0.2
```

### **For Fast-Paced Game:**
```
Move Speed: 4
Jump Force: 7
Fall Multiplier: 2.0
Air Control: 0.6
```

## üì± **Testing Your Settings:**

1. **Play the game** and test movement
2. **Try jumping** - should feel controlled, not too high
3. **Test movement** - should feel smooth, not jerky
4. **Adjust values** in Inspector as needed
5. **Fine-tune** until it feels perfect for your game

## üéØ **Recommended Starting Point:**

For most 2D platformers, these settings work well:
```
Move Speed: 3
Jump Force: 6
Dash Force: 15
Fall Multiplier: 2.5
Air Control: 0.5
```

The movement should now feel much more controlled and professional!
